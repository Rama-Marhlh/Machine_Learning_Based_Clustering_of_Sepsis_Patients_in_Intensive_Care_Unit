# Machine_Learning_Based_Clustering_of_Sepsis_Patients_in_Intensive_Care_Unit

Abstract
Abstract Sepsis is a critical condition characterized by
high prevalence and mortality rates. Early identification
of sepsis presents difficulties due to the absence of specific
markers and its diverse causes . Despite numerous studies and efforts, the complex nature of sepsis and the variability in its clinical presentation have left significant gaps
in effective diagnosis and treatment strategies. This study
leverages advanced machine learning techniques, specifically Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), to categorize sepsis patients into clinically meaningful subgroups based on
the rich dataset from the MIMIC-IV database. By employing rigorous statistical analysis and hyperparameter optimization, we identified distinct patient clusters, each with
unique clinical and demographic characteristics. The study
further utilized a CatBoost classifier to predict patient outcomes, with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis providing insights into the factors driving model predictions. Our findings underscore the potential of AI-driven
clustering to enhance sepsis management by facilitating
personalized treatment strategies, ultimately aiming to improve patient prognosis and healthcare delivery for sepsis.
However, the persistent challenge of accurately identifying
and managing sepsis in a diverse patient population indicates the need for continued research and innovation in this
field
